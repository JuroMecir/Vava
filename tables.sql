But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that marked you as a hero of the people.','Feature: Rustic Hospitality: Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.','Suggested Characteristics: A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(2,'Cloistered Scholar','Skill Proficiencies: History, plus your choice of one from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion','Tool Proficiencies: None','Languages: Two of your choice','Equipment: The scholar\"s robes of your cloister, a writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed book on the subject of your current study, and a pouch containing 10 gp','Feature: Library Access: Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.','Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the   as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity.','NULL','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(3,'Faction Agent','Skill Proficiencies: Insight and one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice, as appropriate to your faction','Tool Proficiencies: None','Languages: Two of your choice','Equipment: Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp','Feature: Factions of the Sword Coast: The lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some possibilities.','Feature: Safe Haven: As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.','Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the   as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity. (For instance, consider the words \"faith\" and \"faction\" to be interchangeable.)','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(4,'Entertainer','Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance','Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, one type of musical instrument','Languages: None','Equipment: A musical instrument (one of your choice), the favor of an admirer (love letter, lock of hair, or trinket), a costume, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp','Feature: Entertainer Routines: A good entertainer is versatile, spicing up every performance with a variety of different routines. Choose one to three routines or roll on the table below to define your expertise as an entertainer.','Feature: By Popular Demand: You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble\"s court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.','Suggested Characteristics: Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience\"s attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They\"re inclined toward the romantic and often cling to high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the appreciation of beauty.','Variant Entertainer: Gladiator: A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment-perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. You can replace the musical instrument in your equipment package with an inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a trident or net.','NULL','NULL'),(5,'Faceless','Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Intimidation','Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit','Languages: One of your choice','Equipment: A disguise kit, a costume, a pouch containing 10gp','Feature: Faceless Persona: A faceless character adventures behind a mask of a public persona. This persona is as natural to them as their hidden, true face, but it disguises their identity. Roll on the Faceless Persona table to determine your persona, or work with the DM to create a persona that\"s unique to your character and suits the tone of your game.','Feature: Dual Personalities: Most of your fellow adventurers and the world know you as your persona. Those who seek to learn more about you—your weakness, your origins, your purpose—find themselves stymied by your disguise. Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection betwen your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness.','Suggested Characteristics: A faceless character usually plays their persona—the hero or extraordinary person they are every day. That\"s all a facade, though, or a part of them expressed to an extreme. To define a persona, feel free to choose characteristics from other backgrounds, particularly folk hero, hermit, or noble. For the person behind the persona, the one who truly strives to be faceless, consider a distinct set of faceless characreristics. As a result, those with this background have two sets of characteristics, one for their persona, and one for their faceless selves.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(6,'Criminal','Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth','Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, thieves\" tools','Languages: None','Equipment: A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp','Feature: Criminal Specialty: There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves\" guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.','Feature: Criminal Contact: You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.','Suggested Characteristics: Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.','Variant Criminal: Spy: Although your capabilities are not much different from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned and practiced them in a very different context: as an espionage agent. You might have been an officially sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder.','NULL','NULL'),(7,'Courtier','Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion','Tool Proficiencies: None','Languages: Two of your choice','Equipment: A set of fine clothes and a pouch containing 5 gp','Feature: Court Functionary: Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are.','Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the   as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity.','NULL','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(8,'Clan Crafter','Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight','Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan\"s tools','Languages: Dwarvish or one other of your choice if you already speak Dwarvish','Equipment: A set of artisan\"s tools with which you are proficient, a maker\"s mark chisel used to mark your handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you learned your skill from, a set of traveler\"s clothes, and a pouch containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp','Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk: As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You always have free room and board in any place where shield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individuals in such a settlement might vie among themselves to determine who can offer you (and possibly your compatriots) the finest accommodations and assistance.','Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the   as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity. (For instance, consider the words \"guild\" and \"clan\" to be interchangeable.)','NULL','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(9,'Far Traveler','Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception','Tool Proficiencies: Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland','Languages: Any one of your choice','Equipment: One set of traveler\"s clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland\"s craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp','Feature: Why Are You Here?: A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each location.','Feature: Where Are You From?: The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background.','Feature: All Eyes on You: Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(10,'Uthgardt Tribe Member','Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival','Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument or artisan\"s tools','Languages: One of your choice','Equipment: A hunting trap, a totemic token or set of tattoos marking your loyalty to Uthgar and your tribal totem, a set of traveler\"s clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp','Feature: Barbarian Tribes of Faerûn: Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either it or the   can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of the other barbarian tribes in Faerûn.','Feature: Uthgardt Tribes and Their Territories: For most Uthgardt tribes, the only stability in their history is the site of their ancestral mound. Most of the Uthgardt holy sites have existed since antiquity, but the fortunes of the tribes that revere them have hardly been static. Following are brief descriptions of the Uthgardt tribes today.','Feature: Uthgardt Heritage: You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe\"s territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there.','Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the   as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity.','NULL','NULL'),(11,'Charlatan','Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Sleight of Hand','Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, forgery kit','Languages: None','Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, tools of the con of your choice (ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, a set of weighted dice, a deck of marked cards, or a signet ring of an imaginary duke), and a belt pouch containing 15 gp','Feature: Favorite Schemes: Every charlatan has an angle they use in preference to other schemes. Choose a favorite scam or roll on the table below.','Feature: False Identity: You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.','Suggested Characteristics: Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(12,'Urchin','Skill Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth','Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, thieves\" tools','Languages: None','Equipment: A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp','Feature: City Secrets: You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.','Suggested Characteristics: Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.','NULL','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(13,'Acolyte','Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion','Tool Proficiencies: None','Languages: Two of your choice','Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp','Feature: Shelter of the Faithful: As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.','Suggested Characteristics: Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.','NULL','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(14,'Waterdhavian Noble','Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion','Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or one musical instrument','Languages: One of your choice','Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine   or wine, and a purse containing 20 gp','Feature: Kept in Style: While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name a~d signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family\"s estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe.','Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the   as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity.','NULL','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(15,'Anthropologist','Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion','Tool Proficiencies: None','Languages: Two of your choice','Equipment: A leather-bound diary, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a set of traveler\"s clothes, one trinket of special significance, and a pouch containing 10 gp','Feature: Cultural Chameleon: Before becoming an adventurer, you spent much of your adult life away from your homeland, living among people different from your kin. You came to understand these foreign cultures and the ways of their people, who eventually treated you as one of their own. One culture had more of an influence on you than any other, shaping your beliefs and customs. Choose a race whose culture you\"ve adopted.','Feature: Adept Linguist: You can communicate with humanoids who don\"t speak any language you know. You must observe the humanoids interacting with one another for at least 1 day, after which you learn a handful of important words, expressions, and gestures – enough to communicate on a rudimentary level.','Suggested Characteristics: Anthropologists leave behind the societies into which they were born to discover what life ls like in other parts of the world. They seek to see how other races and civilizations survive – or why they did not. Some anthropologists are driven by intellectual curiosity, while others want the fame and recognition that comes with being the first to discover a new people, a lost tribe, or the truth about an ancient empire\"s downfall.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(16,'Archaeologist','Skill Proficiencies: History, Survival','Tool Proficiencies: Cartographer\"s tools or navigator\"s tools','Languages: One of your choice','Equipment: A wooden case containing a map to a ruin or dungeon, a bullseye lantern, a miner\"s pick, a set of traveler\"s clothes, a shovel, a two-person tent, a trinket recovered from a dig site, and a pouch containing 25 gp','Feature: Dust Digger: Prior to becoming an adventurer, you spent most of your young life crawling around in the dust, pilfering relics of questionable value from crypts and ruins. Though you managed to sell a few of your discoveries and earn enough coin to buy proper adventuring gear, you have held onto an item that has great emotional value to you. Roll on the Signature Item table to see what you have, or choose an item from the table.','Feature: Historical Knowledge: When you enter a ruin or dungeon, you can correctly ascertain its original purpose and determine its builders, whether those were dwarves, elves, humans, yuan-ti, or some other known race. In addition, you can determine the monetary value of art objects more than a century old.','Suggested Characteristics: Few archaeologists can resist the lure of an unexplored ruin or dungeon, particularly if such a site is the source of legends or is rumored to contain the treasures and relics of wizards, warlords, or royalty. Some archaeologists plunder for wealth or fame, while others consider it their calling to illuminate the past or keep the world\"s greatest treasures from falling into the wrong hands. Whatever their motivations, archaeologists combine the qualities of a scrappy historian with the self-made heroism of a treasure-hunting scoundrel.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(17,'Urban Bounty Hunter','Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth','Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from among one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and thieves\" tools','Languages: None','Equipment: A set of clothes appropriate to your duties and a pouch containing 20 gp','Feature: Ear to the Ground: You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area.','Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the   as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity.','NULL','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(18,'Outlander','Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival','Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument','Languages: One of your choice','Equipment: A staff, a hunting trap, a trophy from an animal you killed, a set of traveler\"s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp','Feature: Origin: You\"ve been to strange places and seen things that others cannot begin to fathom. Consider some of the distant lands you have visited, and how they impacted you. You can roll on the following table to determine your occupation during your time in the wild, or choose one that best fits your character.','Feature: Wanderer: You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth.','Suggested Characteristics: Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(19,'Soldier','Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Intimidation','Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)','Languages: None','Equipment: An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from a fallen enemy (a dagger, broken blade, or piece of a banner), a set of bone dice or deck of cards, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp','Feature: Specialty: During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:','Feature: Military Rank: You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.','Suggested Characteristics: The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(20,'Sage','Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, History','Tool Proficiencies: None','Languages: Two of your choice','Equipment: A bottle of black ink, a quill, a small knife, a letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have not yet been able to answer, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp','Feature: Specialty: To determine the nature of your scholarly training, roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below.','Feature: Researcher: When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an aDventure or even a whole campaign.','Suggested Characteristics: Sages arc defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly – sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other ideals.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(21,'Mercenary Veteran','Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Persuasion','Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)','Languages: None','Equipment: A uniform of your company (traveler\"s clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wages (10 gp)','Feature: Mercenaries of the North: Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below.','Feature: Mercenary Life: You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.','Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the   as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(22,'Knight','Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion','Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set','Languages: One of your choice','Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp','Feature: Position of Privilege: Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.','Suggested Characteristics: Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds –responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family\"s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.','Variant Noble: Knight: A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature below instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).','Variant Feature: Retainers: If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege.','NULL','NULL'),(23,'Knight of the Order','Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order','Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical instrument','Languages: One of your choice','Equipment: One set of traveler\"s clothes, a signet, banner or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp','Feature: Knightly Orders of Faerûn: Many who rightfully call themselves \"knight\" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor\"s Eternal Order or Mystra\"s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and non-governmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word \"knight\" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.','Feature: Knightly Regard: You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community – whether a lone settlement or a great nation that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals.','Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the   as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(24,'House Agent','Skill Proficiencies: Investigation, Persuasion','Tool Proficiencies: Two proficiencies from the House Tool Proficiencies table','Languages: None','Equipment: A set of fine clothes, house signet ring, identification papers, and a purse containing 20 gp','Feature: Role: You always gather information for your house, but when a baron give you a specific mission, what sort of work do you do? The House Agent Role table gives possibilities.','Feature: House Connection: As an agent of your house, you can always get food and lodging for yourself and your friends at a house enclave. When the house assigns you a mission, it will usually provide you with the necessary supplies and transportation. Beyond this, you have many old friends, mentors, and rivals in your house, and you may encounter one of them when you interact with a house business. The degree to which such acquaintances are willing to help you depends on your current standing in your house.','Suggested Characteristics: House agents are diverse. Consider the house you serve and the work you do when choosing characteristics.','NULL','NULL','NULL'),(25,'Guild Artisan','Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion','Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan\"s tools','Languages: One of your choice','Equipment: A set of artisan\"s tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of traveler\"s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp','Feature: Guild Business: Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.','Feature: Guild Membership: As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.','Suggested Characteristics: Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they\"re vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.','Variant Guild Artisan: Guild Merchant: Instead of an artisans\" guild, you might belong to a guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don\"t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region.

The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.','Suggested Characteristics: Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company.

A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.','Other Hermits: This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people, look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte might be what you\"re looking for. Or you could even be a charlatan, posing as a wise and holy person and letting pious fools support you.','NULL','NULL');

More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed.

An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin\"s mood:  is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer\"s harvest is shared with all. \n  is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers. \n  is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter\"s sorrow passes. \n  is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy. Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin\"s current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.

You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:  This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier.

The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.  When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song\"s end or when it is closed.
